This project was created for my A-Level Computer Science coursework, which received full marks, mostly for the project report below, which outlines the problem analysis, design of the system, development, testing
and evaluation of the system.

Since completeness was not a marking point for the coursework, one major feature (Prim's algorithm) and a few minor, discretionary features (introduction to algorithms, example questions etc.) remain incomplete.
The crux of the system is the functional, interactive visualisation of both the Simplex algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm, allowing the user to input their own graphs to have Kruskal's algorithm find a 
minimum spanning tree, or enter their own constraints and objective function to be maximised by the Simplex algorithm, displaying and explaining each tableau for each iteration.

This project focuses heavily on the implementation of various aspects of mathematics, from linear programming to graph theory.
